**NOTE: This is a fork of [Archinamon](https://github.com/Archinamon)'s [AspectJExampleAndroid](https://github.com/Archinamon/AspectJExampleAndroid) project demonstrating autodetection of an app's method calls using AspectJ rather than forcing the developer to annotate methods by hand.**

The `kotlin`, `groovy`, `proguard`, `dagger` and `annotion` portions have been removed, and the AppStartNotifier example has been added.

See the rewound-to-profiler-only branch for the minimum changes needed to add Profiler aspects to a basic project.

Please clone from the original repository, as this one will likely be taken down.
